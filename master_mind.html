        <p style="margin-top: 20pt; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px;"> <strong>Master Mind</strong> was an individual first-year deliverable as part of EE Software Engineering I module. 
            The project was designed to introduce us to and apply our knowledge gained from weekly lab sessions, specifically dealing with data structures such as 
            <i>hash maps, vector operation and structs</i>. The game is written purely in C++ and can run on the command line with some user input parameters to run the game algorithms.<br><br><br>
            Unlike 2048, this assignment was less strict to specification and had a competitive nature as the fastest timed solution scored highest marks. A report was also written to explain our 
            approach, decision decisions and evaluation of time-based performance metrics. A skeleton code was provided for a working <i>maker</i> and <i>solver</i>, albeit the latter being highly 
            inefficient. The overall aim of the assignment was to improve these two functionalities and present a competitive code. 
            <br><br><br>
            In this game, the user must provide an input for length and sequence of the code to be tested. The game then generates a random sequence of numbers defined by input length with numbers 
            ranging from <i>0...N</i>. The code solver tries to find the optimum sequence using minimum number of attempts and receives feedback on its guess. If the guess includes a number at the
            correct position, the solver returns a black hit or if the guess includes a number at the wrong position the solver returns a white hit. By doing so, the game can eliminate large proportions
            of all possible solutions and make a better guess as its next move is based on historic data about black/white hits. The game ends when a sequence, of length L, has been found with all L black
            hits and no white hits. 
            <br><br><br>
            My key learning in this project was <i>algorithmic</i> software engineering skills. It was my first experience of a large project where I learned how to choose the best data structure, in this case hash maps, 
            for the purpose of Max Parts algorithm. I had to independently research suitable algorithms and my report compares the performance metrics for different algorithms. This gave me a stronger understanding
            of how a programmer has to holistically think of many solutions before deciding optimum one.
